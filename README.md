In this project, I have used the Citibike data available online to build a predictive model to predict ETA for a rider from one destination to another.

Following are the python notebooks:
1. "Git Citibike Dataset-Predictive Modeling.ipynb"- This is the predictive model for predicting the ETA
2. "Git Visualizations- rider performance, popular trips, trip duration by user type and busiest bike.ipynb" - Exploratory Data Analysis
