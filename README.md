In this project, I have used the Citibike data available online to build a predictive model to predict ETA for a rider from one destination to another.

Following are the python notebooks:
1. "Git Citibike Dataset-Predictive Modeling.ipynb"- This is the predictive model for predicting the ETA
2. "Git Visualizations- rider performance, popular trips, trip duration by user type and busiest bike.ipynb" - Exploratory Data Analysis
3. "Git Top 5 stations with the most starts (showing # of starts).ipynb"- Interactive map of NYC showing the top 5 station origins fro Citibike

Note: The interactivce map isn't seen here on Git but if you run the same code on the publicly available "Citibike" dataset, you will be able to see the interactive map. Aletrnately, download the .html file to view the map..
